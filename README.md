### A research project in hyperreality

The hyperreal is best described by one of the early authors on this subject:

“Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: A hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - that engenders the territory.” 

Jean Baudrillard in Simulacra and Simulation, published in 1981.
